## Key Takeaways

- **Tailwind CSS 4**: I love it. The new features are really cool. It was in Beta during this project but gradient styling is very appreciated.
- **AI Tools**: I wanted to see if it would save time since the project is just "a landing page". What I discovered is while AI tools are beneficial when truly stuck, they're not a catch-all solution yet. I would refrain from using AI as a holistic solution. In such a small project it created more problems than solved.

## Areas for Improvement
Reflecting on this demo, here are some aspects that could be improved:

1. **Code Organization**: Splitting the code into smaller, more manageable components would enhance maintainability and readability.
2. **Naming Conventions**: Adopting a more consistent and intuitive naming scheme would make the codebase easier to understand and work with.
3. **Defining Brand Colors Early**: Establishing a clear palette of "brand" colors at the beginning of the project would ensure a cohesive and consistent visual identity.
